KAIST Motion Planning & Application (CS686): Fall 2020 Course Project
----

**Base Paper**: Robot Motion Planning in Learned Latent Spaces https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10366.pdf  
This repository is a fork of the original work: https://github.com/StanfordASL/LSBMP

The project in a nutshell:
----

The project goal is to replicate the original work and to explore its capabilities.   
Moreover, we try to improve its performances introducing a **learned sampler** in the latent control action sampling process.
